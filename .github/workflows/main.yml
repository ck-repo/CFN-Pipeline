# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the Source branch
  push:
    branches: [ Source ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ Source ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

- name: Run taskcat tests
  # You may pin to the exact commit or the version.
  # uses: ShahradR/action-taskcat@e9fb2b06f6882ac122ac1eed84d689ab277ff467
  uses: ShahradR/action-taskcat@v1.4.0
  with:
    # Command, subcommands, and arguments to pass to taskcat. Should be formatted as "[args] <command> [args] [subcommand] [args]". The taskcat invocation itself is already handled by the action-no need to prefix the command with "taskcat".

    commands: 
    # If set to "true", this action will update taskcat its the latest version before running tests.

    update_taskcat: # optional
    # If set to "true", this action will update cfn-lit to its latest version before running tests.

    update_cfn_lint: # optional
